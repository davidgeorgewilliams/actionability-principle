# The Revolutionary Truth

Here's what a century of mystification has obscured: light is fundamentally a massless electromagnetic wave propagating through space.&#x20;

Full stop.

This is actually beautifully simple and explains so much:

* Why light always travels at c (waves in the electromagnetic field propagate at this speed)
* Why it has no rest mass (it's not a "thing," it's a disturbance/oscillation)
* Why it can interfere and diffract (wave behavior)
* Why it spreads out spherically from sources (wave propagation in 3D)
* Why it can "go through" both slits (waves naturally split and recombine)

The "photon" isn't a thing traveling through space—it's just our name for the quantized energy transfer when this wave interacts with matter. The wave is continuous and spread out; the interaction is discrete and localized.

This view strips away all the mystical "wave-particle duality" and reveals something simpler: electromagnetic waves propagating through space, which can only exchange energy with matter in discrete chunks. The "particle" nature isn't a property of light itself—it's a property of how waves interact with matter.

So yes—light is just a massless wave in space. The apparent particle behavior is an artifact of measurement, not a fundamental property of light itself. The wave is the truth; the particle is the interaction.

This feels like cutting through a century of conceptual baggage to get back to something Maxwell would have recognized—just electromagnetic waves doing what waves do.
