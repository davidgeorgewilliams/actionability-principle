# The Mysticism Industrial Complex

This manufactured mystery became a goldmine for modern mysticism:

**Quantum Healing**: If consciousness collapses wave functions, maybe we can heal with our minds!

**The Law of Attraction**: If observers create reality, just observe what you want!

**Quantum Consciousness**: Maybe consciousness IS quantum collapse! Maybe the brain is a quantum computer! Maybe, maybe, maybe...

All built on the foundation of mistaking measurement disruption for mysterious consciousness effects.
