# The Cost of Wrong Questions

The quantum consciousness industry is worth billions. Countless hours of research are wasted on the "hard problem" of consciousness "emerging" from matter. Serious scientists have to waste time debunking quantum mysticism instead of doing real work.

All because we couldn't admit that when you measure something, you interact with it. All because we needed light to be mysterious particles instead of prosaic waves. All because wrong questions, once institutionalized, become dogma.
