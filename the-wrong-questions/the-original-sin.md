# The Original Sin

The standard narrative goes like this: Light sometimes behaves as a wave, sometimes as a particle. When we don't observe it, it's a wave. When we do observe it, it becomes a particle. Therefore, observation creates reality.

But look at what actually happens:

1. **The "Single Photon" Fiction**: Scientists claim to send "single photons" through double slits. But as our conversation revealed, this is pure assumption. Taylor in 1909 couldn't verify single photons—he just dimmed his light until statistics suggested maybe one quantum at a time. Even modern photomultiplier tubes don't detect "photons"—they produce electrical pulses we interpret as photon arrivals.
2. **The Retroactive Story**: We see a click at a detector and declare "a photon passed through the apparatus." But we never observed anything passing through. We're writing a story backwards from the ending.
3. **The Measurement Miracle**: When detectors are placed at the slits, the interference pattern disappears. The standard story: we've discovered which slit the photon went through! The reality: we've disrupted the wave with an energy-absorbing device.
