# From Bad Physics to Worse Philosophy

This circular reasoning created a "measurement problem" that doesn't actually exist. The wave doesn't mysteriously "collapse" when observedâ€”the detector interaction disrupts it through physical energy exchange. But instead of recognizing this prosaic fact, physicists mystified it.

Enter the consciousness interpretations:

* "The wave function collapses when observed"
* "Consciousness is required to create definite outcomes"
* "The observer creates reality through measurement"

Each step takes us further from the simple truth: light is a wave, and when you stick a detector in its path, you disrupt it.
