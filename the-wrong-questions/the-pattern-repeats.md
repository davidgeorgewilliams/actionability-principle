# The Pattern Repeats

This quantum mysticism is just one example of a broader pattern:

1. **Create confusion through imprecise language** (wave OR particle, observer "causes" collapse)
2. **Reify the confusion into a mystery** (the measurement problem, wave-particle duality)
3. **Invoke consciousness to "solve" the mystery** (consciousness creates reality)
4. **Profit from the manufactured mysticism** (quantum healing, manifestation, etc.)

The same pattern appears everywhere emergence is invoked:

* **Life**: How does dead matter become alive? Must be emergence! (Rather than: life IS complex chemistry)
* **Mind**: How do neurons create consciousness? Must be emergence! (Rather than: consciousness IS neural activity experienced from the inside)
* **Society**: How do individuals create culture? Must be emergence! (Rather than: culture IS patterns of individual behavior)
