# The Quantum Shell Game

Consider one of physics' most celebrated "mysteries": wave-particle duality. Light, we're told, sometimes behaves as a wave, sometimes as a particle. When unobserved, it passes through both slits in the famous double-slit experiment. When observed, it "chooses" just one. The observer, apparently, creates reality.

This narrative has spawned an entire industry of quantum mysticismâ€”from quantum healing to consciousness-creates-reality philosophies. But what if the mystery itself is fraudulent? What if we've been asking the wrong questions all along?

Through careful examination of what actually happens in these experiments, we can expose how circular reasoning and measurement bias created a false mystery that became the foundation for some of the most pernicious pseudoscience in modern culture.

Let's trace how physicists manufactured this confusion and how it metastasized into the belief that consciousness creates reality.
