# The Wrong Questions Multiply

Once you start with wrong questions, they metastasize:

* "How does the photon know which slit to go through?"
* "Does the photon go through both slits simultaneously?"
* "How does consciousness collapse the wave function?"
* "Is the moon there when nobody looks?"

Each question assumes what it should be investigating. Each deepens the confusion.

The right questions would be:

* How does electromagnetic radiation propagate?
* What happens when EM waves interact with matter?
* Why are energy exchanges quantized?

But these questions don't generate mystery. They don't sell books. They don't justify conferences on consciousness creating reality.
