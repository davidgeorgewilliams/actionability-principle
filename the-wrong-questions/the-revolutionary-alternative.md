# The Revolutionary Alternative

What if we simply stopped asking wrong questions?

What if light is just a wave that interacts with matter in discrete energy exchanges?

What if consciousness is just what neural activity feels like from the inside?

What if emergence is just our name for when we're too lazy to track the details?

The mysticism evaporates. The confusion dissolves. What's left is a universe that's astonishing in its complexity but not mysterious in its foundations.

But then, how would we justify our conferences, our journals, our sense of studying something profound?

Better to keep the mystery alive. Better to keep asking the wrong questions.

Until now.
