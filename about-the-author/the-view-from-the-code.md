# The View from the Code

I'm not your typical philosopher of science. I'm a machine learning engineer who has spent two decades inside the very systems that supposedly exhibit "emergence"â€”and I can tell you definitively: they don't.

While others theorize about consciousness emerging from neural networks, I've built them. While philosophers debate how markets emerge from individual transactions, I've engineered the algorithms that power them. While academics mystify quantum effects in computing, I've implemented systems that exploit them.

And in every single case, I've found the same thing: no emergence. Just scale mismatch.
