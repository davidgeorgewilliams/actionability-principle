# The Revolution Is Personal

Twenty years ago, I was a young mathematician fascinated by patterns and complexity. Today, I'm an engineer who has built some of the world's most complex systems. And I can tell you with absolute certainty: the mystery of emergence is a myth we've created to excuse our laziness in finding the right scale of analysis.

Every "emergent" system I've built has confirmed the same truth. Every time someone said "look how consciousness emerges from this neural network," I could show them it was just backpropagation. Every time someone marveled at "emergent market behavior," I could point to the simple rules each trader followed.

The emperor has no clothes. And I've tailored enough emperors to know.
