Today, as founder of Cynthia Systems, I continue pushing the boundaries of AI. But my real mission is to push the boundaries of human understanding. This book isn't just theory—it's field report from twenty years on the front lines of building the future.

I haven't just written about the dissolution of emergence—I've lived it, built it, and seen through it from the inside.

The revolution begins with those who build the future seeing clearly what they're actually building. I'm one of those builders. And what I've seen will change how you see everything.
