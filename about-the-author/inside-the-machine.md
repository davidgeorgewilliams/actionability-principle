# Inside the Machine

At Google, I built fraud detection systems that saved over a billion dollars. At Apple, I designed the AI behind Apple Music and the support systems millions use daily. At Amazon, I architected Alexa's understanding. At PayPal, I revolutionized their customer service AI.

But something bothered me throughout. Everyone talked about "emergent" AI behavior. Yet when you looked inside these systems—when you actually built them—there was no emergence. Just matrix multiplication at scale. The "mystery" existed only in the gap between what we engineers understood and what everyone else imagined.
