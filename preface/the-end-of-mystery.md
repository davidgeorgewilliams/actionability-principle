# The End of Mystery

For over two millennia, we have been telling ourselves a story. It goes like this: The universe is fundamentally mysterious. Consciousness cannot be reduced to matter. Life transcends chemistry. The whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts. And at the deepest level, reality itself depends on observation to exist.

This story has been remarkably successful. It has preserved human dignity in the face of scientific advance. It has maintained space for meaning in an apparently mechanical cosmos. It has justified entire academic disciplines devoted to studying "emergence" and the "hard problems" that supposedly resist solution.

There's just one problem with this story: It's false.

Not false in some subtle philosophical sense. False in the way that "the Earth is flat" is false. False in the way that "disease is caused by evil spirits" is false. Simply, demonstrably, empirically false.

This book presents the alternative: a single equation from which all of physics emerges. Not metaphorically. Not approximately. Exactly.
