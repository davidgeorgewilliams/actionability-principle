# How to Read This Book

Part I exposes the mythology—how we created false mysteries and why we maintain them.

Part II presents the master equation and demonstrates how all physics emerges from it.

Part III explores the implications—from the nature of consciousness to the future of civilization.

Each chapter builds on the previous, but the mathematically inclined can jump directly to Part II. The philosophically oriented might prefer starting with Part I. Those interested in applications should focus on Part III.
