# The Revolutionary Moment

We stand at a unique point in history. The mathematical tools exist. The computational power is available. The experimental precision is sufficient. All that remains is the courage to abandon our cherished mysteries.

This book is not another interpretation or philosophical position. It is a mathematical demonstration. Where others have offered words, we offer equations. Where others have preserved mystery, we provide mechanism. Where others have proclaimed emergence, we prove derivation.
