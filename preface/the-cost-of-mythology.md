# The Cost of Mythology

Why does this matter? Because the mythology of emergence has real costs:

**Scientific costs**: We waste careers studying pseudo-problems. We invoke "emergence" instead of seeking actual explanations. We mistake our confusion for nature's mystery.

**Practical costs**: In AI, economics, and medicine, hand-waving about "emergent phenomena" substitutes for understanding. Systems fail because we've excused ourselves from comprehending them.

**Human costs**: The false mystery alienates us from nature. It makes us strangers in our own universe, observers of a reality we cannot truly grasp. It preserves comforting illusions at the price of genuine understanding.
