# The Promise

From one master principle—that nature minimizes action through the flow of energy density—we will derive:

* Schrödinger's equation (quantum mechanics isn't mysterious)
* Einstein's field equations (spacetime isn't fundamental)
* The laws of thermodynamics (entropy isn't confusing)
* The three dimensions of space (not arbitrary but necessary)
* The hierarchy of physical scales (no fine-tuning required)
* The nature of consciousness (no "hard problem" exists)

We will show that particles are not things but stable flow patterns. That forces are not fundamental but aspects of a single interaction. That spacetime itself emerges from energy density correlations. That consciousness is not mysterious but the natural result of self-referential information flows.
