# A Personal Note

Every author of a unified theory risks being dismissed as a crank. The graveyard of physics is littered with failed attempts at final theories. What makes this different?

Simply this: We make no appeal to new physics. We introduce no additional dimensions, no new particles, no exotic mathematics. We merely show that what we already know, properly understood, is sufficient. The revolution is not in discovering new facts but in recognizing what the known facts mean.

The master equation is not speculative. It is what physics has been telling us all along, if only we had the courage to listen.
