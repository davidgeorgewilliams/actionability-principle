# The Choice Before You

You can close this book and return to the comfortable mystery. Continue believing that consciousness is irreducible, that emergence creates novelty, that the universe is fundamentally beyond comprehension.

Or you can turn the page and discover that the universe is exactly as comprehensible as it appears to be. That the only mystery is why we ever thought there was a mystery. That reality, far from being stranger than we imagine, is precisely as strange as our equations requireâ€”no more, no less.

The choice is yours. But know this: Once you see through the mythology, you cannot unsee it. Once you understand the master equation, the false mysteries dissolve forever.

Welcome to the universe as it actually is.

_Turn the page, and let's begin._
