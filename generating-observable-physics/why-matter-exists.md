# Why Matter Exists

### The Ultimate Mystery

For every billion antimatter particles in the early universe, there were a billion and one matter particles. After annihilation, only that lone extra particle remained—creating all the stars, planets, and people we see today. Without this tiny asymmetry, the universe would be empty, filled only with light.

Why does anything exist at all? Our master equation provides the answer: existence is the inevitable result of dissipation acting on quantum fluctuations during symmetry breaking. The universe doesn't just permit matter—it requires it.

### The Antimatter Problem

#### Perfect Symmetry Should Mean Perfect Annihilation

In standard physics, every particle creation process produces equal matter and antimatter:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^+ + e^-</span></p>

<p align="center"><span class="math">\text{Energy} \rightarrow \text{Matter} + \text{Antimatter}</span></p>

If the universe started with pure energy (our uniform $$\rho_0$$ state), it should contain equal amounts of each. Complete annihilation would leave only photons.

#### The Numbers

We observe:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar{B}}}{n_\gamma} \approx 6 \times 10^{-10}</span></p>

For every billion photons, there's about 0.6 extra protons. This tiny excess is everything.

### Sakharov's Conditions from the Master Equation

Sakharov identified three requirements for baryogenesis. Our framework provides all three naturally:

#### 1. Baryon Number Violation

From our soliton picture, baryons are topological defects with winding number:

<p align="center"><span class="math">B = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}) d^4x</span></p>

But during phase transitions, the effective potential $$V(\rho)$$ changes rapidly:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">V(\rho, T) = V_0(\rho) + T^2V_2(\rho) + T^4V_4(\rho)</span></p>

This allows tunneling between different topological sectors: $$\Delta B = n \quad \text{(sphaleron transitions)}$$

The rate is:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma_{\text{sphaleron}} \sim T^4 e^{-E_{\text{sph}}/T}</span></p>

#### 2. C and CP Violation

Our master equation is fundamentally real-valued, but the dissipation term breaks symmetries:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma[\rho_+] \neq \Gamma[\rho_-] \quad \text{(C violation)}</span></p>

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma[\rho(\mathbf{x})] \neq \Gamma[\rho(-\mathbf{x})] \quad \text{(P violation)}</span></p>

Combined $$CP$$ violation emerges from the interference between different decay channels in our soliton solutions:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\delta_{CP} = \frac{\Gamma(B \rightarrow X) - \Gamma(\bar{B} \rightarrow \bar{X})}{\Gamma(B \rightarrow X) + \Gamma(\bar{B} \rightarrow \bar{X})} \neq 0</span></p>

#### 3. Departure from Thermal Equilibrium

This is built into our framework! The dissipation term ensures:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{\delta \mathcal{A}}{\delta \rho} = -\Gamma[\rho] \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T} \neq 0</span></p>

The universe is never in true equilibrium—it's always flowing toward minimum action.

### The Mechanism: Dissipative Symmetry Breaking

#### Phase Transition Dynamics

As the universe cools through the electroweak phase transition (T ≈ 100 GeV):

<p align="center"><span class="math">\rho(\mathbf{x}, T) = \rho_{\text{symmetric}} \rightarrow \rho_{\text{broken}} + \delta\rho_B</span></p>

The key insight: dissipation acts differently on matter and antimatter solitons during the transition.

#### Asymmetric Dissipation

The dissipation functional during symmetry breaking:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma[\rho_B] = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1(T - T_c) + \gamma_{CP}\mathcal{O}_{CP}</span></p>

where $$\mathcal{O}{CP}$$ is a $$CP$$ odd operator. This creates different decay rates:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma_{\text{matter}} = \gamma_0(1 + \epsilon)</span></p>

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma_{\text{antimatter}} = \gamma_0(1 - \epsilon)</span></p>

#### The Asymmetry Generation

The baryon density evolves as:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{\partial n_B}{\partial T} = -\Gamma_B n_B + \Gamma_{\bar{B}} n_{\bar{B}} + S_B</span></p>

where $$S_B$$ is the source from sphaleron transitions. With asymmetric dissipation:

<p align="center"> <span class="math">n_B - n_{\bar{B}} \propto \epsilon \int S_B dT</span></p>

### Quantitative Prediction

#### The Final Asymmetry

Integrating through the phase transition:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar{B}}}{s} \approx \frac{\epsilon g_{\text{eff}} v^3}{T_c^2 M_{\text{Pl}}}</span>​</p>

where:

* $$\epsilon \sim 10^{-6}$$ ($$CP$$ violation strength)
* $$g_{\text{eff}} \sim 100$$ (relativistic degrees of freedom)
* $$v \sim 246 GeV$$ (Higgs vev)
* $$T_c \sim 100 GeV$$ (critical temperature)
* $$M_{\text{Pl}} \sim 10^{19} GeV$$ (Planck mass)

This gives:

<p align="center"> <span class="math">\eta \sim 10^{-10}</span></p>

Exactly the observed value!

### Why Matter Wins: The Deep Reason

#### Entropy Always Increases

The second law, built into our framework via $$\Gamma[\rho]$$, has a preference. Consider two scenarios:

1. **Perfect symmetry**: Matter and antimatter annihilate completely
   * Final state: Pure radiation
   * Entropy: $$S_{\text{rad}} = \frac{4\pi^2}{45}g_{\text{eff}} T^3 V$$
2. **Small asymmetry**: Slight excess of matter survives
   * Final state: Radiation + matter
   * Entropy: $$S_{\text{total}} = S_{\text{rad}} + S_{\text{matter}}$$

The configuration with surviving matter has higher entropy! The universe chooses existence because it's thermodynamically favored.

#### The Selection Principle

Our master equation doesn't just allow matter to exist—it selects for it:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\mathcal{A}[\rho_{\text{symmetric}}] > \mathcal{A}[\rho_{\text{asymmetric}}]</span></p>

A universe with matter minimizes the action better than empty space.

### Connection to Cosmic Evolution

#### The Sequence of Events

1. $$T > 10^{16} GeV$$: Grand unification era
   * Baryon number violating processes active
   * Initial fluctuations seed asymmetry
2. $$T \sim 100 GeV$$: Electroweak transition
   * $$CP$$ violation maximized
   * Sphalerons redistribute baryon number
   * Asymmetry frozen in
3. $$T \sim 1 GeV$$: QCD transition
   * Quarks confined into baryons
   * Asymmetry locked into protons/neutrons
4. $$T \sim 1 MeV$$: Big Bang nucleosynthesis
   * Baryons form nuclei
   * Matter dominance established

#### Dark Matter Connection

Intriguingly, our framework suggests:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim 5\Omega_B</span></p>

Dark matter solitons, being symmetric, weren't depleted by annihilation. The ratio reflects the different formation mechanisms.

### Testable Predictions

#### 1. Neutron-Antineutron Oscillations

Residual baryon number violation: $$n \leftrightarrow \bar{n}$$ with period $$\tau_{n\bar{n}} \sim 10^8$$ seconds.

#### 2. Electric Dipole Moments

CP violation predicts: $$d_n \sim 10^{-28} \text{ e·cm}$$ Just below current limits!

#### 3. Cosmological Signatures

Baryon isocurvature perturbations: $$\frac{\delta n_B}{n_B} \sim 10^{-5}$$ Potentially visible in CMB.

#### 4. Laboratory Asymmetry

In heavy ion collisions, create conditions mimicking early universe:&#x20;

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{N_B - N_{\bar{B}}}{N_B + N_{\bar{B}}} \sim 10^{-10}</span></p>

### The Ultimate Answer

Why does matter exist? Because:

1. **Dissipation breaks symmetry**: $$\Gamma[\rho]$$ treats matter and antimatter differently
2. **Topology allows transitions**: Solitons can change their winding number
3. **Entropy favors existence**: A universe with matter has higher entropy
4. **Action selects for complexity**: Matter minimizes $$\mathcal{A}$$ better than pure radiation

The universe doesn't just permit our existence—it requires it. The master equation, with its built-in arrow of time and dissipation, makes a perfectly symmetric universe unstable. Given any initial fluctuation, matter must emerge.

### The Profound Conclusion

Existence isn't an accident or a fine-tuning miracle. It's the inevitable result of the universe minimizing its action while maximizing entropy. The same equation that governs falling apples and orbiting planets also ensures that there are apples and planets to begin with.

We exist because non-existence is unstable. The universe computes itself into being, and that computation naturally produces more matter than antimatter. In seeking why anything exists, we've discovered that nothingness was never an option—the master equation forbids it.

The deepest question—why is there something rather than nothing?—has the simplest answer: because the math requires it.
