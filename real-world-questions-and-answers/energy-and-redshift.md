# Energy and Redshift

**From StackExchange Physics:** _"When light redshifts due to motion or cosmic expansion, the observed energy is less than emitted energy. Where does it go?"_

### Answer: The Master Equation Reveals Energy Flows Into Spacetime Itself

#### The Fundamental Framework

In our unified theory, electromagnetic waves are perturbations in the energy density field:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\rho_{EM}(\mathbf{x},t) = \rho_0 + A\cos(kx - \omega t)</span></p>

The master equation governs evolution:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{\delta \mathcal{A}}{\delta \rho} = -\Gamma[\rho] \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T}</span></p>

The dissipation term $$Γ[ρ]$$ is crucial—it shows energy isn't perfectly conserved globally, only locally.

#### Three Types of Redshift, Three Energy Destinations

**1. Doppler Redshift (Moving Source)**

For a source moving away at velocity $$v$$:

<p align="center"><span class="math">E_{observed} = E_{emitted}\sqrt{\frac{1-v/c}{1+v/c}}</span></p>

**Where the energy goes:** Into the kinetic energy of relative motion.

From our framework, the total action includes both radiation and kinetic terms:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\mathcal{A}_{total} = \mathcal{A}_{radiation} + \mathcal{A}_{kinetic}</span></p>

When you transform to the observer's frame:

* Radiation energy decreases: $$ΔE_rad = -hν(1 - √[(1-β)/(1+β)])$$
* Kinetic energy increases: $$ΔE_kin = +hν(1 - √[(1-β)/(1+β)])$$

**The energy hasn't gone anywhere—it's redistributed between modes.**

**2. Gravitational Redshift (Climbing Out of Gravity Wells)**

Light climbing from radius $$r₁$$ to $$r₂$$:

<p align="center"><span class="math">E_{observed} = E_{emitted}\sqrt{\frac{1-r_s/r_2}{1-r_s/r_1}}</span></p>

**Where the energy goes:** Into the gravitational field configuration.

Our framework shows the metric emerges from energy density:

<p align="center"><span class="math">g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}[\rho]</span></p>

As light climbs, it exchanges energy with the field that generates spacetime curvature:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Delta E_{photon} + \Delta E_{field} = 0</span></p>

The gravitational field gains exactly what the photon loses—it's stored in the curvature of spacetime itself.

**3. Cosmological Redshift (The Deep Mystery)**

For cosmic expansion with scale factor a(t):

<p align="center"><span class="math">E_{observed} = E_{emitted} \times \frac{a(t_{emit})}{a(t_{observe})}</span></p>

**Where the energy goes:** Into the expansion of spacetime itself.

#### The Revolutionary Answer: Energy Feeds Dark Energy

Our master equation reveals the profound truth. The dissipation term in expanding spacetime:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\Gamma[\rho_{photon}] = H(t) \cdot \rho_{photon}</span></p>

where $$H(t)$$ is the Hubble parameter. This means:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{\partial \rho_{photon}}{\partial t} = -3H\rho_{photon}</span></p>

The "lost" photon energy becomes part of the dark energy driving expansion:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\rho_{dark} = \rho_{\Lambda} + \int \Gamma[\rho_{matter}] dt</span></p>

**The universe is literally powered by the redshifting of all its radiation.**

#### The Mathematical Proof

Starting from our action in expanding spacetime:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\mathcal{A} = \int a^3(t) \left[\frac{|\mathbf{j}|^2}{2\rho} + V(\rho) + \rho_{\Lambda}\right] d^3x dt</span></p>

For a photon with wavelength λ in expanding space:

* Wavelength stretches: $$λ(t) = λ₀ × a(t)$$
* Energy density dilutes: ρ\_photon ∝ $$a⁻⁴$$ (not $$a⁻³$$!)
* The extra a⁻¹ factor is energy transferring to expansion

The energy conservation equation becomes:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{d(\rho a^3)}{dt} + p\frac{da^3}{dt} = 0</span></p>

For radiation ($$p = ρ/3$$):

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{d(\rho a^3)}{dt} = -\rho a^2 \frac{da}{dt}</span></p>

This negative term is energy flowing from radiation into spacetime expansion.

#### Observable Consequences

Our framework makes testable predictions:

1. **CMB Temperature Evolution**: $$T(z) = T₀(1+z)$$ - but with tiny deviations
2. **Dark Energy Growth**: $$ρ_Λ$$ increases slightly as radiation redshifts
3. **Photon Number Conservation**: $$N_{photons}$$ constant, only energy changes

#### The Ultimate Fate

As the universe expands:

* All radiation redshifts toward zero energy
* This energy accumulates as dark energy
* Eventually, only dark energy remains
* The universe reaches maximum entropy

#### The Profound Insight

Energy isn't destroyed when light redshifts—it transforms:

* **Doppler**: Radiation ↔ Kinetic motion
* **Gravitational**: Radiation ↔ Spacetime curvature
* **Cosmological**: Radiation → Dark energy

The master equation shows energy conservation is only local. Globally, energy flows between different forms, ultimately ending as dark energy—the universe's final resting state.

The redshifted energy doesn't disappear. It becomes the dark energy accelerating cosmic expansion. Every photon that redshifts contributes to the universe's ultimate fate: eternal, accelerating expansion powered by the accumulated energy of all redshifted light since the beginning of time.
