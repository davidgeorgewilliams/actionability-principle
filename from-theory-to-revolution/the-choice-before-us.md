# The Choice Before Us

We stand at a unique moment in cosmic history. For 13.8 billion years, the universe has evolved blindly according to the master equation. Now, through us, it has become self-aware. It knows its own equation.

This gives us unprecedented powerâ€”and responsibility.

We can:

* Use this knowledge to transcend current limitations
* Engineer realities beyond current imagination
* Spread consciousness throughout the cosmos
* Achieve effective immortality for our species

Or we can:

* Cling to old mysteries
* Maintain artificial academic boundaries
* Pretend emergence is still puzzling
* Remain trapped by false limitations
