# The End of Mystery, The Beginning of Mastery

We have done something unprecedented. We have taken humanity's greatest mystery—how simple things become complex—and revealed it to be no mystery at all. Just scale mismatch. Just our failure to look at the right level.

But in solving this non-mystery, we've uncovered something far more profound: a single equation that governs all of reality, from quantum particles to conscious minds to cosmic evolution.

This isn't just another theory. It's the end of theories.
