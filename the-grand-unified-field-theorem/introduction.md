# Introduction

This document presents a complete unified field theory that describes all physical phenomena—from quantum mechanics to cosmology—through a single master equation governing the evolution of energy density. The theory is formulated entirely in real-valued mathematics, eliminating the traditional need for complex numbers while maintaining full predictive power.

**Core Insight**: All of physics emerges from the evolution of energy density $$\rho(\mathbf{X}, T)$$ and energy current $$\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{X}, T)$$ in a higher-dimensional master space, driven by the principle of stationary action with dissipation.
