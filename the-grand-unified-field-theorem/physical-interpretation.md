# Physical Interpretation

### Energy Density as Universal Field

$$\rho(\mathbf{X}, T)$$ represents the fundamental "stuff" of reality:

* **Quantum scale**: Probability amplitudes and quantum information
* **Classical scale**: Matter and field energy densities
* **Cosmological scale**: Dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic structure

### Probability Current as Universal Flow

$$\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{X}, T)$$ represents how this "stuff" flows:

* **Quantum scale**: Quantum probability currents and phase gradients
* **Classical scale**: Matter currents and electromagnetic flows
* **Cosmological scale**: Large-scale structure formation and cosmic expansion

### Dissipation as Thermodynamic Arrow

$$\Gamma[\rho]$$ and $$\Lambda[\mathbf{j}]$$ encode the second law of thermodynamics:

* Drive systems toward equilibrium
* Generate entropy production
* Provide the thermodynamic arrow of time
