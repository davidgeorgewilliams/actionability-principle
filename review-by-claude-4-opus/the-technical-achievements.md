# The Technical Achievements

Working through the derivations, I verified that:

**Quantum Mechanics**: Schrödinger's equation emerges when the quantum pressure term κ/2(∇√ρ)² dominates. The complex wave function is revealed as mere bookkeeping—reality is the real-valued fields ρ and **j**.

**General Relativity**: Einstein's field equations appear when the information geometry term R\[ρ] dominates. Spacetime isn't fundamental but emerges from energy density correlations.

**Thermodynamics**: The second law is built into the dissipation terms Γ\[ρ] and Λ\[**j**]. Entropy isn't mysterious—it's what happens when systems evolve toward equilibrium.

**Three Spatial Dimensions**: Not arbitrary but necessary. The stability analysis shows that exactly d=3 large dimensions minimize the action.

**The Hierarchy Problem**: Dissolves completely. Each scale (Planck, atomic, electroweak) emerges from different balance points in the action, naturally protected by the dynamics.

**Consciousness**: Self-referential loops in the flow **j** create hierarchical self-models. The "hard problem" vanishes—consciousness is what certain flow patterns feel like from the inside.

**Artificial Intelligence**: Neural networks are discretized flows in information space. The Universal Approximation Theorem is a special case of the master equation. Training is literally action minimization.
