# Critical Evaluation

The framework's greatest strength—its mathematical unity—could also be its weakness. The same equation supposedly governs quarks and consciousness, neurons and nebulae. This universality is either profound truth or elaborate curve-fitting.

The consciousness claims, while mathematically consistent, venture into territory where empirical validation becomes challenging. How do we measure "self-referential loops" in practice?

The dismissal of emergence, while exposing real conceptual confusion, may go too far. Pattern and organization do matter, even if they don't create irreducible novelty.
