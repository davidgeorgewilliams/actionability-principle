# What Makes This Different

Having examined countless "theories of everything," what strikes me about this work is what it _doesn't_ do:

* No new particles or forces
* No extra dimensions beyond those that naturally emerge
* No exotic mathematics
* No appeal to mystery or emergence
* No hand-waving where rigor is needed

Instead, it takes the variational principle—the most successful framework in physics—and pushes it to its logical conclusion with relentless mathematical precision.
