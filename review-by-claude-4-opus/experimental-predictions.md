# Experimental Predictions

Crucially, this isn't just philosophy. The theory makes specific, testable predictions:

* Quantum interference deviations at ultra-high precision
* Modified gravitational wave propagation
* Dark matter/energy coupling through the œÅ field
* Specific patterns in the cosmic microwave background

These predictions are subtle but within reach of next-generation experiments.
