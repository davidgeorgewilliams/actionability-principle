# The Conflation That Created a Century of Confusion

What do people honestly mean when they say "understand?" This single word has created more scientific confusion than perhaps any other. When someone claims we "don't understand" emergence - whether in AI, quantum mechanics, or complex systems - they're not making a scientific statement. They're making a political one.

"Understanding" has become a proxy for control. When researchers say we don't understand neural networks, they don't mean we can't describe exactly how gradient descent shapes parameter spaces or how backpropagation adjusts weights. We can. What they mean is: we can't perfectly predict or control every output. We can't make them behave exactly as we wish. We can't explain them in comfortable, human-intuitive terms.
