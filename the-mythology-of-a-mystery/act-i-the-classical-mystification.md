# Act I: The Classical Mystification

The seeds of our false mystery were planted by Aristotle, though he likely never intended to create the confusion that would follow. When he wrote that "the whole is more than the sum of its parts," he was making a straightforward observation about organization and structure. A house is not merely a pile of bricksâ€”it is bricks arranged in a particular way. No mystery there.

But language has a way of transforming the mundane into the mystical. "More than the sum" began to suggest something transcendent, something that violated the basic logic of addition. If you have all the parts, how could the whole be "more"? Where did the "extra" come from?

This linguistic confusion would have remained a philosopher's parlor game, except that it coincided with humanity's growing need to preserve certain cherished beliefs. As natural philosophy began to explain more of the world in mechanical terms, those who wished to maintain the specialness of life, mind, and soul needed a way to resist the encroachment of mechanism. Emergence became their refuge.
