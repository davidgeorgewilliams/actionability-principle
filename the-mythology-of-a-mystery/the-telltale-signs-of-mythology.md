# The Telltale Signs of Mythology

How can we recognize that emergence is mythology rather than mystery? The signs are everywhere:

**Definitional proliferation**: Real phenomena have stable definitions. Mythologies spawn endless variations. Count the definitions of emergence in the literature—weak, strong, nominal, ontological, epistemological, synchronic, diachronic... The multiplication of categories is a defensive mechanism.

**Retreat behavior**: When science explains a supposedly emergent phenomenon, emergentists don't celebrate—they retreat. Chemistry emerged from physics? Well, consciousness still emerges! The pattern reveals that emergence is whatever hasn't been explained yet.

**Appeal to intuition**: Emergentists constantly invoke what "seems" to be the case. Water "seems" different from H2O. Consciousness "seems" different from neural activity. But seeming is not being. Our intuitions evolved for survival, not philosophy.

**Theological language**: Notice how often emergentists use religious terminology. Natural "piety." Accepting with "faith." The "mystery" of consciousness. This is the vocabulary of theology, not science.

**Unfalsifiability**: Try to imagine what would disprove emergence. If we explain consciousness physically, emergentists will point to some other phenomenon. If we explain everything, they'll say the explanations themselves are emergent. The doctrine is designed to be preservation-proof.
