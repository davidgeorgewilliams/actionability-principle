# The Cost of Mythology

This mythology is not harmless. It has real costs:

**Scientific costs**: Emergence discourse diverts resources from actual explanation. Instead of figuring out how consciousness works, we debate whether it's weakly or strongly emergent. Instead of understanding markets, we invoke emergence and call it a day.

**Philosophical costs**: The mythology prevents clear thinking about the relationship between levels of description. We waste centuries on pseudo-problems that dissolve once we abandon the emergence framework.

**Practical costs**: In AI, medicine, economics, and other applied fields, the emergence mythology licenses hand-waving where we need precision. "It's an emergent phenomenon" becomes an excuse for not understanding your own system.

**Cultural costs**: The mythology perpetuates the very dualism it claims to resolve. By insisting there's something "more" to wholes than their parts, we maintain the nature/spirit divide that has plagued Western thought for millennia.
