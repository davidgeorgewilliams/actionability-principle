# The Birth of a False Enigma

In the beginning, there was a simple observation: things made of parts sometimes behave differently than their parts do separately. Water feels wet, though hydrogen and oxygen gases do not. Ant colonies build complex structures, though individual ants wander seemingly at random. The human mind experiences consciousness, though neurons merely fire electrochemical signals.

This observation required no mystery. It was merely a fact about the world, as mundane as noting that things fall down rather than up. But humanity has never been content with simple facts. We are meaning-making machines, and where meaning is absent, we manufacture it. Where complexity exists, we invent mystery.

Thus began the mythology of emergence.
