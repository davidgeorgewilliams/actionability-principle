# Act II: The Mystification Engine

By the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution had demonstrated the power of reductionist thinking. Machines could be understood completely by understanding their parts. But this very success created a counter-reaction. If humans were merely machines, what happened to free will, consciousness, the soul?

Enter the British Emergentists.

John Stuart Mill, with his distinction between "homopathic" and "heteropathic" effects, gave the mystery its first systematic framework. When causes combined mechanically, their effects were predictable—mere sums. But when they combined chemically, something "emerged" that could not have been predicted. The mystery deepened: how could the universe contain two fundamentally different kinds of causation?

The answer, of course, is that it doesn't. Mill was simply noticing that some systems are harder to predict than others. But instead of acknowledging this prosaic fact, he and his followers built an entire metaphysical edifice around it.

C. Lloyd Morgan added evolution to the mix, suggesting that emergence was the universe's way of creating genuine novelty. Samuel Alexander spoke of accepting emergence with "natural piety"—a telling phrase that reveals how emergence had become a quasi-religious concept, something to be accepted on faith rather than understood.

But it was C.D. Broad who gave the mystery its most influential formulation. His thought experiment of the "mathematical archangel" who could know everything about physics yet still not predict the emergence of new properties became the template for all future mystification. The idea was seductive: no matter how much we know, there will always be something that escapes our understanding.
