# Act III: The Great Dispersal

As the 20th century progressed, the mythology of emergence spread like a virus through the disciplines. Each field that encountered complex phenomena—life, mind, society—imported the emergence concept to protect its phenomena from the perceived threat of reduction.

In physics, quantum mechanics provided new fuel for the mystery. Entanglement and superposition seemed to show that wholes could indeed have properties their parts lacked. Never mind that these were precisely describable mathematical phenomena—they felt mysterious, and that was enough.

In biology, the emergence mythology protected the specialness of life. How could mere chemicals become living beings? It must be emergence! The fact that biochemistry was steadily explaining exactly how chemicals become living beings was conveniently ignored.

In neuroscience and philosophy of mind, emergence became the last refuge of consciousness. As neuroscience mapped more and more of the brain's functions, consciousness became the final frontier—the emergent property par excellence that would forever resist physical explanation.

In social sciences, emergence explained everything from market crashes to revolutions. Why did these phenomena seem unpredictable? Emergence! It became a universal excuse for incomplete understanding.
