# Act IV: The Institutionalization of Mystery

By the late 20th century, emergence had achieved something remarkable: it had become simultaneously a topic of serious academic study and a way to avoid serious explanation. Entire conferences were devoted to it. Journals were founded to explore it. Centers for the study of "complex systems" proliferated.

The mythology had institutionalized itself.

What's particularly revealing is how the definition of emergence kept shifting to stay ahead of explanation. When chemistry was reduced to physics, chemical emergence was quietly abandoned. When computers began exhibiting complex behaviors from simple rules, emergence was redefined to exclude algorithmic phenomena. Each time science explained a previously "emergent" phenomenon, the goalposts moved.

This is the hallmark of a mythology: it adapts to preserve itself.
