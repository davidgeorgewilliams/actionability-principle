# Why We Resist the Right Scale

Why do we cling to emergence instead of simply adjusting our scale?&#x20;

Several reasons:

* **Cognitive comfort**: We want to work at familiar scalesâ€”human-sized, human-timed. But nature doesn't care about our comfort.
* **Academic territories**: Entire fields are built around specific scales. Admitting scale mismatch threatens departmental boundaries.
* **Mystical appeal**: "Emergence" sounds profound. "I was looking at the wrong scale" sounds like failure.
* **Funding structures**: You can get grants to study emergence. You can't get grants to admit you were using the wrong microscope.
