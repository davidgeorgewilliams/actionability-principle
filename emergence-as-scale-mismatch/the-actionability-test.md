# The Actionability Test

Here's how to know if you're at the right scale:

1. **Can you make useful predictions?** If not, adjust your scale.
2. **Do you need to invoke emergence?** If yes, you're at the wrong scale.
3. **Are your interventions effective?** If not, you're probably working at the wrong level.

The right scale is where:

* Patterns are visible
* Predictions are possible
* Interventions are effective
* "Emergence" disappears
