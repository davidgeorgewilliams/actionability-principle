# The Actionability Framework

The solution isn't to invoke mysterious "emergent properties." It's to find the scale at which patterns become actionableâ€”where we can see, predict, and interact with the system effectively.

**The Framework:**

1. **Identify the scale of interaction**: What level do you actually need to work at? You don't need to track every molecule to predict weather. You don't need to understand quarks to bake bread.
2. **Match models to purposes**: A city planner doesn't need to model individual neurons to predict traffic patterns. They need to model cars, roads, and daily routines.
3. **Recognize when you're at the wrong scale**: Is your prediction failing? Are you invoking "emergence"? You're probably looking at the wrong level.
4. **Adjust until actionable**: Move up or down scales until patterns become clear and useful. The right scale is where complexity becomes manageable.
