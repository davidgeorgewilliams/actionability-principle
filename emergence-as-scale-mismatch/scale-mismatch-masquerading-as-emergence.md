# Scale Mismatch Masquerading as Emergence

**Consciousness**: We stare at neurons and wonder how they "create" consciousness. But consciousness isn't created by neurons—it IS the activity of neural networks experienced at the appropriate scale. Looking for consciousness in individual neurons is like looking for traffic jams in carburetors.

**Life**: We examine chemicals and wonder how they "become" alive. But life isn't something added to chemistry—it IS chemistry at the scale of self-replicating systems. The mystery only exists because we're looking at the wrong level.

**Markets**: We track individual trades and wonder how they "produce" market behavior. But markets ARE the patterns of trades at scale. The "invisible hand" is just our mystification of ordinary scale effects.

**Evolution**: We look at random mutations and wonder how they "generate" complex organisms. But evolution IS just differential reproduction at population scales over time. The "emergence" of complexity is just compound interest working on variation.
