# The Death of Downward Causation

The most pernicious myth of emergence is "downward causation"—the idea that higher-level properties somehow reach down and affect lower levels. This is pure scale confusion.

When a flock of birds "causes" individual birds to change direction, nothing is reaching down from flock-level to bird-level. Each bird is responding to its neighbors. The "flock behavior" is just our name for the pattern at scale.

When consciousness "causes" neurons to fire, there's no top-down causation. The neural firing IS the consciousness, viewed from a different scale. It's like saying "the dance causes the dancers to move"—a category error born of scale confusion.
