# The Master Equation

The evolution of all systems—quantum, gravitational, biological, economic—follows one master principle:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\frac{\delta \mathcal{A}[\rho, \mathbf{j}]}{\delta \rho} = -\Gamma[\rho] \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}</span>​​</p>

Where:

* $$\mathcal{A}[\rho, \mathbf{j}]$$ is the action functional (nature's "cost function")
* $$\Gamma[\rho]$$ is the dissipation functional (enforces the second law of thermodynamics)
* The left side is the "force" trying to minimize the action
* The right side is dissipation driving the system toward equilibrium
