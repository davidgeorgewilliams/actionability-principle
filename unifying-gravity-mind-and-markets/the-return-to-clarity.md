# A Return to Clarity

After dismantling centuries of mystification about emergence, we arrive at something profound: a single equation that unifies all of physics—from quantum mechanics to general relativity to thermodynamics—and extends naturally to describe complex systems like minds and markets.

This isn't mysticism. It's the opposite: a return to clarity that shows how all phenomena arise from the flow and concentration of energy density through spacetime.
