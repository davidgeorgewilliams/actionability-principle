# The Universal Pattern

Before diving into the mathematics, let's recognize something remarkable: the same fundamental pattern appears across every domain of knowledge.

### In Artificial Intelligence

* **Gradient descent**: Systems evolve to minimize loss functions
* **Maximum likelihood**: Models gravitate toward configurations that best explain data
* **Reinforcement learning**: Agents discover policies that maximize expected reward
* **Energy-based models**: Probability distributions emerge from energy landscapes

### In Physics

* **Principle of least action**: Particles follow paths that minimize action
* **Thermodynamic equilibrium**: Systems evolve toward minimum free energy
* **General relativity**: Spacetime geometry minimizes the Einstein-Hilbert action
* **Quantum mechanics**: Evolution follows paths that extremize the quantum action

### In Economics

* **Market equilibrium**: Prices move toward supply-demand balance
* **Utility maximization**: Agents make choices that optimize their preferences
* **Efficient markets**: Information gets incorporated to minimize arbitrage
* **Game theory**: Strategies converge to Nash equilibria (minimum regret)

**The profound realization**: These aren't analogies. They're all manifestations of the same underlying principle.
