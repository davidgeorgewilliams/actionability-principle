# The Fundamental Insight

Reality, at its deepest level, is about the distribution and flow of "stuff"—call it energy, information, or existence itself. Everything else—particles, forces, consciousness, markets—emerges from patterns in this distribution.

We describe this with two real-valued fields:

* $$\rho(\mathbf{x}, t)$$: The density of "stuff" at each point in spacetime
* $$\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x}, t)$$: How that "stuff" flows

No mysterious wave-particle duality. No consciousness creating reality. Just density and flow.
