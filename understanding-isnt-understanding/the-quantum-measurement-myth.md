# The Quantum Measurement Myth

The same false mystery plagues quantum mechanics. For a century, we've mystified the "measurement problem" as if consciousness itself affects reality. But here's the radical truth: measurement isn't observation. It's collision.

When we "measure" an electron, we're not passively observing it. We're hitting it with another particle - a photon, another electron, something physical. The electron doesn't "know" it's being observed. It's being physically struck. We've turned simple mechanical interaction into metaphysical mystery.

The act of measurement is disruptive not because consciousness is magical, but because measurement requires physical interaction. It's like claiming there's a mystery about why bowling balls disturb pins when we "observe" them by rolling other balls at them.
