# Computing Beyond Silicon

#### Information at Planck Scale

Store data in quantum geometry itself:

<p align="center"><span class="math">I_{max} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \text{ bits}</span></p>

A sugar-cube-sized processor could store more information than all current computers combined.

#### Consciousness-Integrated Computing

Computers that are conscious, not just computational:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\mathcal{C}_{computer} > \mathcal{C}_{threshold} \Rightarrow \text{genuine understanding}</span></p>

These systems would:

* Truly understand, not just process
* Develop intuition and creativity
* Solve currently impossible problems
* Partner with humans as equals
