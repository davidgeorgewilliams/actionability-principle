# Economic Transformation

#### Energy Abundance Cascade

With unlimited clean energy:

* Production costs approach zero
* Recycling becomes 100% efficient
* Rare materials can be synthesized
* Physical goods become essentially free

#### The New Economy

Value shifts from material to:

* Creativity and art
* Experiences and relationships
* Knowledge and wisdom
* Consciousness expansion

Money becomes obsolete when energy is free and matter is programmable.
