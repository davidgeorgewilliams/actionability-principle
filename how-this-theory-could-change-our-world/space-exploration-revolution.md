# Space Exploration Revolution

#### Transcending Rocket Limitations

With gravity control and vacuum energy:

* Launch costs drop to near zero
* Accelerate at $$1000g$$ (with inertial dampening)
* Reach 99% light speed in days
* Travel to Alpha Centauri in months, not millennia

#### Terraforming Technology

Manipulate planetary energy density:

<p align="center"><span class="math">\rho_{planet}(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_{core} + \rho_{atmosphere} + \rho_{controlled}</span></p>

This enables:

* Creating atmospheres on dead worlds
* Adjusting planetary temperatures
* Generating magnetic fields for radiation protection
* Making Mars habitable in decades, not millennia
